# üëã Hi there! I'm Daniel Andr√©s Cabana Trejos

I'm a Systems Engineering student, passionate about programming, logic, and everything that involves understanding how things work in order to improve them. I enjoy writing code that is clean, precise, and meaningful‚Äîalways looking for the best way to solve a problem.

### üß† A bit about me

- I'm into web development, both **frontend** and **backend**.
- I like to understand every part of a system‚Äînot just to make it work, but to make it make sense.
- I love working in teams, sharing ideas, and learning from others.
- I'm drawn to challenges: complex projects, and learning new things every day.

### üß± Architectures & Methodologies I use

- **Clean Architecture**: writing software that is easy to test, extend and maintain.  
- **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**: designing systems that are independent from frameworks and infrastructure.  
- **Onion Architecture**: focusing on the core domain logic, with clear separation between layers.  
- **Layered Architecture**: organizing code in Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository for better modularity and maintainability.  
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: separating concerns between data, user interface, and control logic.  
- **Atomic Design**: building UI components from the ground up with atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.  
- **Feature-Sliced Design**: structuring frontend apps using domain-focused layers like features, entities, shared, and widgets.

### üöÄ What drives me

- Projects that combine **creativity and technology**.
- Environments where constant learning and improvement are part of the process.
- Teams that value good communication, collaboration, and building meaningful solutions.
